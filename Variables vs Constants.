#This is a comment
#Variables VS Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANT are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "TeamSpeak"
Team2Name = "Discord"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change, of course.)
#Variables can NOT start with a number.
#E.g. 1TeamName = "TeamSpeak"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have a space in the name 
#e.g. Team Name = "Discord"
#This will be a syntax error

#This is a example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values is a constant do not change
