#Lesson One - "HELLO WORLD PROGRAM"

#Question one - Identify a string in the program
# The string would be the 'hello world'

#Question two - state what strings must be enclosed with 
# The string must always be enclosed with quotation marks

#def output():
 # print("hi world")

#output()

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Lesson two - "Python carpet cost"

#Questions:
#Q1 - Explain the purpose of the int command in lines 15, 16 and 17.
#A1 - The purpose of it is so that when the values are inputted, it will then use that data to work out a logical answer to the question being asked of it earlier.

#Q2 - Explain why a subprogram was used in lines 6-10 instead of writing the code from line 19 onwards.
#A2 - A sub-program was used because it could likely be added to another piece of code or something like that, IDK.

# Subprograms

#def carpet_cost(width, length, price):
 #   carpet = width * length * price
  #  grippers = width + length
 #   fitting = 50
 #   return carpet + grippers + fitting
    
# -------------------------
# Main program
# -------------------------
#width = int(input("Enter the width of the room to nearest meter: "))
#length = int(input("Enter the length of the room to nearest meter: "))
#price = float(input("Enter the price of the carpet per m2: "))
#print("The total cost is: £", carpet_cost(width, length, price))

my version:

def cost_of_an_underlay(width,length,price):
  underlay = width * length * price 
  gripping = width + length
  fitting = 50 
  return underlay + gripping + fitting
  
width = int(input("Enter the width of the room to nearest meter: "))
length = int(input("Enter the length of the room to nearest meter: "))
price = float(input("Enter the price of the underlay per m2: "))
print("The total cost is: £", cost_of_an_underlay(width,length,price))
